                Hello and welcome all to the project of Team – Rising Coders! Our group consists of 6 members – Raj, Soumyadeep,Ahona,Ahili,Akhil and Suchismita. Our project falls under the ‘innovation in the healthcare’ category.
                The problem that we are tackling today was actually a problem faced by our team member – Raj. One fine rainy afternoon when he was sitting at home, he wished for a plate of samosas and green chutney. Like any teenager, instead of going out – he decided to order online. However, belonging to a rural area, he was shocked to find that popular apps like Zomato and Swiggy do not deliver to his doorstep. 
                Unfortunately, he was forced to go out and purchase from a local shop, some 1 km away. 
                This same problem comes when someone from a rural area tries buying medicine online from apps like PharmEasy, Apollo, etc. 
                Aiming to find a solution to this problem, we created our website – MediNear.

                MediNear is a one-stop solution for all.
                Let us say, you live in rural or semi-urban area, or even an urban area. You must have pharmacies around you within a radius of 5-20 km – we shall call them ‘local pharmacies’.
                Local Pharmacies would have registered themselves in our website and listed the medicines they sell. The medicine list will keep getting updated based on available stock.

                Now, let’s say a day comes when you are bedridden with high fever. You are unable to go outside and purchase medicines. You go to our website,create a customer account. Now, you have two options. Either you directly search for the medicine you need. Or, in the search bar which is asking ‘what ailment do you have?’ you type in fever. On typing in fever, you will be presented with a series of medicine options present in your nearest pharmacy which are also recommended by the known doctors in India. According to your need, you can select the quantity of medicine and proceed to checkout. 
                Our website will immediately inform the selected pharmacy and they will pack your order and send them to your doorstep by a salesman belonging to their own shop. The direct pharmacy to customer home service will reduce the delivery charge significantly as cycles and walking are the two methods of travel in rural areas.
